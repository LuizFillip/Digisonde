This repository contains the ionosonde data analysis from 
[EMBRACE](http://www2.inpe.br/climaespacial/portal/en/) database. 

## About

But first, it is necessary to pre-process the raw data (ionograms) using the SAO explorer program, which is manual processing most of the time and  often requires a lot of technique and experience from the user in each type  of ionogram configuration. For example, during the occurence of Equatorial Spread F (ESF), which is most often associated with the occurrence of EPBs,  compromise significantly the visualization of ionograms due the presence of diffuse traces that may appear in frequency and/or height.
