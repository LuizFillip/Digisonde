# IONOSONDE DATA ANALYSIS

This repository contains the ionosonde data analysis from 
[EMBRACE](http://www2.inpe.br/climaespacial/portal/en/) database. 


But first, it is necessary to pre-process the raw data (ionograms) using 
the SAO explorer program, which is manual processing most of the time and 
often requires a lot of technique and experience from the user in each type 
of ionogram configuration. For example, the phenomenon of F scattering, 
which is most often associated with the occurrence of equatorial plasma bubbles
(EPBs) significantly distorts the visualization of ionograms with the presence
of diffuse traces that may appear in frequency and/or height.

Therefore, this directory is intended only for the data product already 
processed by SAO Explorer. Which is made the analysis of the real 
height of the ionospheric F layer for each frequency that can vary from 2 to 12 MHz.
